### **Data & Analysis Layer**

1. **Sentiment Analysis from News & Social Media** — Scrape financial news (Moneycontrol, Economic Times, Twitter/X) and run sentiment scoring. Stocks with sudden sentiment shifts often precede price moves.

2. **Fundamental Analysis Module** — P/E, P/B, ROE, ROCE, Debt-to-Equity, Dividend Yield, EPS growth. Compare against sector averages. Many retail investors only look at technicals — combining both gives an edge.

3. **Sector Heatmap** — Visual grid showing which sectors (IT, Banking, Pharma, Auto, FMCG, Metals) are hot/cold based on aggregate price movement. Helps identify sector rotation.


5. **Fibonacci Retracement Levels** — Auto-calculate Fib levels on price charts. Traders heavily rely on 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% levels for entries/exits.

6. **Volume Profile Analysis** — Show where maximum volume was traded at specific price levels. POC (Point of Control) acts as a magnet for price.

### **AI & Prediction Layer**

7. **AI Pattern Recognition on Historical Data** — Train on past 5-year data: "When RSI was X, MACD crossed Y, and price was near SMA200 — what happened next?" Show historical win rate of similar setups.

8. **Multi-Timeframe Confluence** — AI checks if daily, weekly, and monthly charts all agree on direction. Confluence = higher probability trades.

9. **AI Market Regime Detection** — Classify current market as Trending/Ranging/Volatile. Different strategies work in different regimes.

10. **Earnings & Event Calendar with AI Impact Prediction** — Before quarterly results, AI predicts likely impact based on sector trends, peer performance, and historical earnings reactions.

### **Portfolio Intelligence**

11. **Risk Analytics** — Portfolio beta, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, sector concentration risk. Alert if portfolio is over-exposed to one sector.

12. **AI Rebalancing Suggestions** — "Your portfolio is 60% banking. Consider diversifying into IT/Pharma based on current market regime."

13. **Tax-Loss Harvesting Alerts** — Flag stocks in loss that can be sold before March 31 for tax benefits, with suggestion to re-enter after wash period.

### **Alerts & Automation**

14. **Price & Technical Alerts** — "Alert me when RELIANCE crosses ₹1500" or "Alert when RSI drops below 30." Push notifications.

15. **AI Daily Morning Brief** — Every market morning at 9:00 AM, AI sends a summary: overnight global markets, pre-market signals, top picks for the day.

16. **Breakout Scanner** — Real-time scan for stocks breaking above resistance or below support with volume confirmation.



20. Indian retail investors care deeply about P/E, P/B, ROE, ROCE, Debt/Equity, dividend yield, promoter holding, and quarterly results. Screener.in and Tickertape dominate here. 

 8. No Alerts / Push Notifications
  Traders need price alerts, technical breakout alerts, and earnings reminders. Without push notifications, users have no reason to keep the app installed. They'll check it once and forget.
